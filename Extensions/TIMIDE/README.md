# TIMIDE

An 8-bit IDE and Compact Flash interface for the TIM-011 for the expansion header. This requires the updated ROM by Marko Šolajić which can be found here:

  [TIM011 System Software](https://github.com/msolajic/tim011-system-software)

The default IO address for the board as used by the ROM, selectable by jumper is E8. To date we've not found an 8 bit compatable IDE drive to work with this board, but a standard Amazon / AliExpress CompactFlash to IDE adapter works fine (pictured).

Marko's site also provides a CF image to get things going.
