# TIM-011B Releases

Each releases folder contains a Kicad, Gerbers and BOM folder, the latter containing the generated iBOM to help build the board.

## v1.1

Initial public release. This doesn't deviate much from the original 1987 board. Please check out the revision notes, currently on the repository home readme for modifications.
