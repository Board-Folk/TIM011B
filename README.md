This repository contains the BOM, gerbers and Kicad files for a remake of the TIM-011 from the Mihajlo Pupin Institute of Serbia, 1987.

This is as a base point - we're trying not to deviate from the original board too much so it can still be considered a replica. Feel free to fork and make your own mods outside of that. Folder Expansions will contain add on extensions to the board.
